# PyTorch Examples

A repository showcasing examples of using pytorch

Basic examples:
- MNIST Convnets
- Word level Language Modeling using LSTM RNNs
- Training Imagenet Classifiers with Residual Networks
- Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)
- Variational Auto-Encoders
- Superresolution using an efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network
- Hogwild training of shared ConvNets across multiple processes on MNIST
- Training a CartPole to balance in OpenAI Gym using REINFORCE

Larger examples / whole projects:
- OpenNMT: A PyTorch port of [OpenNMT](https://gitter.im/OpenNMT/openmt), a sequence to sequence model for Neural Translation
